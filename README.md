# My dotfiles

## What?

If you don't know what dotfiles are, I highly recommended [GitHub's guide on the subject](http://dotfiles.github.io/).

## Why?

So I can keep a centralized version of my settings and tools.

## Who?

I forked a lot of stuff from [@holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) but I also grabbed some pieces here and there from other dotfiles repos.

## How?

Just run the install script and watch the magic happen. Every file ending with .symlink will be symlinked to your HOME directory.

## When?

[You know what time it is?!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=7LBxr5ZScqE#t=148)
